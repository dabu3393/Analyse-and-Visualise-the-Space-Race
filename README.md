## Getting Started

This project analyzes space mission data from the beginning of the Space Race in 1957 to provide insights into the history of space exploration. The data is scraped from nextspaceflight.com and includes information on mission launches, organizations, countries, costs, and mission statuses.

## Data
The data for this project is stored in a CSV file named mission_launches.csv. You can obtain the data from nextspaceflight.com or by using your preferred method for web scraping.

## Data Analysis
The project provides insights into the data, including:

- The number of launches per organization.
- The number of active versus retired rockets.
- The distribution of mission status (successful vs. failed).
- The distribution of launch prices.
- The number of launches by country.
- The number of failures by country.
- A sunburst chart showing countries, organizations, and mission status.
- Total money spent by organization on space missions.
- The cost per launch by organization.
- The number of launches per year.
- The number of launches month-on-month.
- How the launch price varied over time.
- The total number of launches by the top 10 organizations.
- A comparison of the USA and the USSR's launches during the Cold War.
- Various charts showing launch statistics over time.

## Visualization
The project utilizes Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization. Various charts and graphs are created to visualize the data's key insights.
